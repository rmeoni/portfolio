Hi, my name is Rodrigo.

00:00:03.684 --> 00:00:07.267
I'm 30 years old
and I'm originally from Guatemala City.

00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:11.594
I'm a little bit of a design
nerd and I also enjoy coding.

00:00:13.014 --> 00:00:15.988
I have over ten years of experience
working in tech.

00:00:16.326 --> 00:00:19.335
I specialize as a UX designer
and developer.

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:22.343
Also known as UX developer.

00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:24.540
My journey into UX

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.901
felt a little bit backwards
in a way, or as I like to say,

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:31.943
as if I was “reverse engineering it”

00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:35.999
I began building websites
about ten years ago

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.988
by simply editing text, colors, and images

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:43.504
out of pre-made templates.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.222
Shortly after that, a mentor of mine
told me I wasn't a programmer.

00:00:48.304 --> 00:00:51.312
That really motivated me
to prove otherwise.

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:53.476
So I began studying a

00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:56.484
Ruby on Rails
full stack course, learned to code,

00:00:56.822 --> 00:01:01.284
and found myself replicating templates
and calling myself a web developer.

00:01:03.447 --> 00:01:04.157
Later on, I

00:01:04.157 --> 00:01:07.740
began learning design tools
such as Figma, Adobe XD,

00:01:08.078 --> 00:01:12.270
and Sketch,
as well as visual design principles

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:15.853
and the foundations of building
Design Systems.

00:01:17.137 --> 00:01:20.450
I also got pulled in by react once
Facebook popularized it

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:25.115
and began designing
and developing my own original projects.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.273
However, I was still mostly relying
in my own assumptions

00:01:29.273 --> 00:01:32.518
and the occasional feedback
from colleagues and friends.

00:01:34.242 --> 00:01:35.898
About five years ago,

00:01:35.898 --> 00:01:38.906
I truly discovered
what UX was all about,

00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:41.611
citing Google's motto.

00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:44.754
Put the user first
and the rest will follow.

00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:48.709
I fell in love with UX
when I began studying

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.921
for the Google UX Design
Professional Certificate.

00:01:52.664 --> 00:01:55.335
It felt like all the pieces finally fell

00:01:55.335 --> 00:01:58.343
into place.

00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:00.946
My journey to UX felt like learning

00:02:00.946 --> 00:02:05.340
how to build a house
before knowing how to design one.

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.870
However,
after I realized that it was just a matter

00:02:10.174 --> 00:02:14.298
of rotating the frame
and utilizing my skills

00:02:14.974 --> 00:02:19.909
to design and develop experiences
that will make people's lives better.
