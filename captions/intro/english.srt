Hi, my name is Rodrigo.

2
00:00:03,684 --> 00:00:07,267
I'm 30 years old
and I'm originally from Guatemala City.

3
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:11,594
I'm a little bit of a design
nerd and I also enjoy coding.

4
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:15,988
I have over ten years of experience
working in tech.

5
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:19,335
I specialize as a UX designer
and developer.

6
00:00:19,335 --> 00:00:22,343
Also known as UX developer.

7
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:24,540
My journey into UX

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,901
felt a little bit backwards
in a way, or as I like to say,

9
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:31,943
as if I was “reverse engineering it”

10
00:00:32,754 --> 00:00:35,999
I began building websites
about ten years ago

11
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:39,988
by simply editing text, colors, and images

12
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:43,504
out of pre-made templates.

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,222
Shortly after that, a mentor of mine
told me I wasn't a programmer.

14
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:51,312
That really motivated me
to prove otherwise.

15
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:53,476
So I began studying a

16
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:56,484
Ruby on Rails
full stack course, learned to code,

17
00:00:56,822 --> 00:01:01,284
and found myself replicating templates
and calling myself a web developer.

18
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:04,157
Later on, I

19
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:07,740
began learning design tools
such as Figma, Adobe XD,

20
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:12,270
and Sketch,
as well as visual design principles

21
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:15,853
and the foundations of building
Design Systems.

22
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:20,450
I also got pulled in by react once
Facebook popularized it

23
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:25,115
and began designing
and developing my own original projects.

24
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,273
However, I was still mostly relying
in my own assumptions

25
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:32,518
and the occasional feedback
from colleagues and friends.

26
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:35,898
About five years ago,

27
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:38,906
I truly discovered
what UX was all about,

28
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:41,611
citing Google's motto.

29
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:44,754
Put the user first
and the rest will follow.

30
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:48,709
I fell in love with UX
when I began studying

31
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,921
for the Google UX Design
Professional Certificate.

32
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:55,335
It felt like all the pieces finally fell

33
00:01:55,335 --> 00:01:58,343
into place.

34
00:01:58,343 --> 00:02:00,946
My journey to UX felt like learning

35
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:05,340
how to build a house
before knowing how to design one.

36
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:09,870
However,
after I realized that it was just a matter

37
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:14,298
of rotating the frame
and utilizing my skills

38
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:19,909
to design and develop experiences
that will make people's lives better.
